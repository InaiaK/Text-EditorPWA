  ## Description
Notepad is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that runs in the browser. It is a single-page application that features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as a redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by a specific browser. The application also functions offline. The app uses a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and are used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
